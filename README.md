Here's what I gained from the project:

‚≠êÔ∏è I acquired a multitude of valuable skills and concepts in front-end web development. Throughout the tutorial, I explored essential topics such as UI design, data handling, and styling efficiency using Tailwind CSS.

‚≠êÔ∏è With Next.js, I gained practical experience in building both server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. I deepened my understanding of client-side vs server-side components, learning how to leverage each approach effectively depending on the project requirements and constraints.
